## User Experience (UX)

### User Stories

- As a user, I want to play a quick game of memory.
- As a user, I want to be able to access to rules of the game.

## Design

### Colour scheme

### Typography

“Montserrat” is the font used for this website, with a sans serif as a fallback. The font is simple and provides good readability.

### Visuals

The memory cards use consistent symbols as well as the card back. Overall, the page looks consistent and makes the user want to play a round of memory.

### Wireframes

All wireframes were designed for laptop/desktop, iPad/tablet, and phone screens.
